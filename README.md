# Su-etal-2024

This repository contains all the files and code used for the Su et al., (2024) manuscript titled: **No effect of partial reinforcement on fear extinction learning and memory in C57BL/6J mice**

There are two versions of the data and data analysis code:

(v1) From our original submission to a preprint server:
https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8udn5

* The files associated with this version are:
          +  R notebook: Su-etal-2024.Rmd
          +  html: Su-etal-2024.html
          +  Data files: 
                    +  Figure_1_2_PREE
                    +  Figure_3_PREE_LowUS_10percent
                    +  Figure_4B-C_OneFC
                    +  Figure_4E-F_Interpolated Extinction

(v2) We submitted this article for peer-review. In response to reviewer feedback, we modified our analysis. We also carried out a minor change in how the data is organized. Before, data files and metadata (eg subject id, condition) were in separate csv files. These have been combined into one file per experiment.
